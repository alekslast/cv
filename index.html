                        I graduated as a chemist, but later my interests have greatly changed for innovation technologies
                        and management. At that time, I was not able to enter the field as a programmer due to lack of required
                        skills and experience. That is why I have decided to start as project manager, mastering programming
                        along the way to become a developer or product owner later on.
